    <h2>
      My passion for Development
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since I can remember I have been developing. Developing has given me an opportunity to express my creative side
      and at the same time challenge my logical thinking. It takes creativity to solve a problem. You have to
      orchestrate all the
      languages, their strengths and weaknesses, making a harmony.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love what I do. I think what makes me so passionate about it is you are always learning. Especially when you try
      new things. So learn to make new
      mistakes, fail fast and keep moving.
      Sometimes it takes failing to learn how to be better.

    <h2>
      My passion for UX and HCD
    </h2>
    <p>
      It wasn't too long ago when healthcare.gov was launched. It wasn't long ago when healthcare.gov failed. Not the
      idea, but the site. Healthcare.gov failed because they didn't know their audience, they did not
      research their users. For too long we have tried to serve the needs of others by assuming what they want. We need
      to
      meet people wherever they are.
